# About

I bought a Huawei Mate Book Pro X 2018 (i5 8G). As I don't use W*ndows 
and don't like to be controlled by an OS, but instead controll my computers,
I installed Debian on day one. As I don't like W*ndows I don't like OSes
that try be as "user friendly" as W*indows, so I don't use systemd, gnome, ...

So this setup starts with a minimal Debian9, then I add X11, an xterm, a 
window manger and a browser. Nothing more is needed the way I work.

On the way there are some more packages to controll the computer. And some
packages are not allowed.

This repository is a collection of config files and scripts for a system
I like to work with.
